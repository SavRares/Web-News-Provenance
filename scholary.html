            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This project develops a web platform to manage and explore the provenance of online newspaper articles,
                including text and multimedia content. It uses metadata models like DCMI, ITPC Standards, and the
                Social Semantic Web Thesaurus to structure articles and integrates external data from DBpedia.
                The platform, inspired by Europeana Stories and The London Gazette, allows users to query, visualize,
                and recommend relevant content based on rich semantic metadata.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The use of semantic web technologies in online content management marks a substantial shift in how
                information is structured, accessible, and shared on the internet. Traditional online technologies
                rely mainly on static HTML and metadata, which can limit the richness and interconnectedness of web
                information. On the other hand, the semantic web uses technologies like SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and
                RDF Query Language) and RDF (Resource Description Framework) to create a more intelligent and dynamic
                web.
                These technologies make it possible to create structured, machine-readable data that is simple to
                comprehend,
                query, and connect across various platforms.</p>

            <h2>Internal Data Structures and Models</h2>
            <p>The core data structure involves representing News Articles, Topics, and Media. This can be mapped to the
                following models:</p>

            <h3>NewsArticle Model</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ID:</strong> URI (<code>rdf:type</code> in the RDF) to uniquely identify each news article.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Title:</strong> The title of the news article (<code>dc1:title</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> A short description or summary of the article
                    (<code>dc1:description</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Source:</strong> The news source(<code>dc1:source</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Date:</strong> The date the article was published (<code>dc1:date</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Author:</strong> The author of the article (<code>dc1:author</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Content:</strong> The content of the article (<code>dc1:content</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Identifier:</strong> A reference to an external identifier (<code>dc1:identifier</code>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Topics:</strong> A collection of topics related to the article (<code>ns1:topic</code>).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Media Model</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ID:</strong> URI (<code>rdf:about</code> in the RDF) to uniquely identify the media object.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> The type of media (<code>iptc:DigitalSourceType</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Multiple image URLs as resources (<code>dc1:identifier</code>), each
                    representing different versions or representations of the media.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Entity Model for Subject and Topics</h3>
            <p>Each subject is represented as a separate entity with a URI and a
                collection of identifiers for cross-referencing in the knowledge base for DBpedia.</p>

            <h3>Databases Used in the Project</h3>
            <p>In this project, two types of databases are utilized: SQLite and Fuseki. Each serves a different purpose
                in terms of data storage and querying capabilities.</p>

            <h3>SQLite Database</h3>
            <p>The SQLite database is used to store structured data, such as news articles, metadata, and associated
                properties.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Stores metadata such as titles, dates, and authors.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Details</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Database type: SQLite</li>
                        <li>Tables: Articles, Multimedia, Topics</li>
                        <li>Querying method: SQL</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fuseki Database</h3>
            <p>The Fuseki database serves as a SPARQL endpoint for querying RDF data stored in the project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Used to query RDF data via SPARQL queries.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Details</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Database type: Fuseki (SPARQL endpoint)</li>
                        <li>Data format: RDF, JSON, JSON-LD, RDFa</li>
                        <li>Querying method: SPARQL</li>
                        <li>Access: HTTP-based endpoint</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Implemented API</h2>
            <p>The project includes an API that provides access to the internal data structures and models. The API
                allows users to perform various operations, such as querying articles, retrieving metadata, and
                accessing multimedia content. The API is designed to be RESTful, providing a simple and intuitive
                interface for interacting with the system.</p>
            <p>
                The API was implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The API endpoints are
                designed to provide access to news articles, topics, and multimedia content in a structured and
                efficient manner. The API supports various HTTP methods such as GET and POST to enable different
                operations on the data. The API responses are formatted in JSON, XML, and Turtle to support different
                data formats and serialization methods. The API also includes support for SPARQL queries to enable
                advanced data retrieval and manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>The API endpoints include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GET /news</strong>: Retrieves a list of news in a paginated format. In order to take only a part of the news, the user can specify the following parameters:
                    <ul>
                        <li>skip - the number of news to skip</li>
                        <li>take - how many news to take</li>
                    </ul>
                    We decided to implement this feature in this manner in order to reduce the amount of data that is sent to the client.
                    This way, the client will receive only the data that it shows, and when the client goes to the next page, it will receive the next set of data.
                </li>
                <li><strong>GET /news/{id}</strong>: Retrieves detailed information about a specific article
                    identified by its ID.
                </li>
                <li><strong>GET /topics/{topic}</strong>: Retrieves recommended news with the same topic as the one specified in the URL. This endpoint is useful for providing users with related articles based on a specific topic of interest. </li>
                <li><strong> GET /news_rdf_xml/{id}</strong>: Retrieves the news details as a XML. </li>    
                <li><strong> GET /news_rdf_turtle/{id}</strong>: Retrieves the news details as a Turtle. </li>
                <li><strong>POST /sparql</strong>: Based on the query provided by the user and the format of the response the API provides articles in different formats:
                    <ul>
                        <li>JSON: Shown as table</li>
                        <li>JSON-LD: Show as json-ld</li>
                        <li>RDFa: Shown as RDFa</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RDF-Based Knowledge Model</h2>
            <h3>Considerations on the Designed/Reused RDF Model</h3>
            <p>The system integrates a carefully designed RDF-based knowledge model to support structured metadata
                and semantic relationships between entities. The following considerations were made while designing
                or reusing the model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expressiveness</strong>: The ontology ensures a rich and flexible representation of
                    domain concepts, relationships, and attributes to cover essential metadata related to online
                    newspaper articles.</li>
                <li><strong>Vocabulary and Taxonomy</strong>: The system incorporates existing well-defined
                    ontologies such as schema.org, DCMI Metadata Terms, and ITPC Standards to enhance compatibility
                    and avoid redundant vocabulary creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Usage in Context</strong>: The selected ontologies and vocabularies are applied
                    directly to model provenance, classification, and semantic annotation of news articles, ensuring
                    real-world applicability within the developed system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, the ontology was generated and refined using <strong>Protégé</strong>, a widely used
                ontology development tool. The knowledge model was tested within Protégé to validate consistency,
                logical relationships, and expressiveness before integration into the system.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Integration with External Knowledge Sources</h2>
            <p>SPARQL queries are employed to extract relevant data from DBpedia, enriching the
                internal knowledge base with external information. This integration enhances metadata completeness
                and contextual accuracy in news article classification.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conformance to Linked Data Principles</h2>
            <p>The solution adheres to linked data best practices by ensuring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)</strong>: Each entity in the RDF model has a
                    globally unique and dereferenceable URI.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardized RDF Representations</strong>: The system supports RDF serialization formats
                    such as Turtle, JSON-LD, and RDF/XML.</li>
                <li><strong>The use of SPARQL queries allows the data to be machine-readable and searchable</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Non-trivial SPARQL queries of interest</h2>

            <h4>1. Articles Sharing a Topic</h4>
            <p>The following query identifies pairs of articles that share a common topic. This can be useful for
                discovering articles related to similar subjects and understanding how different articles are
                connected.</p>
            <pre>
PREFIX dc1: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
PREFIX ns1: &lt;http://www.socialsemanticweb.org/ns/&gt;

SELECT ?article1 ?article2 ?relation
WHERE {
?article1 ns1:topic | dc1:subject ?topic .
?article2 ns1:topic | dc1:subject ?topic .
FILTER (?article1 != ?article2)
BIND("Shared Topic" AS ?relation)
}
</pre>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This query finds pairs of articles (?article1 and ?article2) that share
                the same topic, using the `dc1:subject` and `ns1:topic` predicates. The `FILTER` clause ensures that
                an article is not compared with itself, and the `BIND` function creates a new variable (`?relation`)
                indicating the shared topic.</p>

            <img src="assets/FirstSpql.png" alt="SparQL query" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

            <h4>2. Articles Linked to DBpedia</h4>
            <p>This query identifies articles that are linked to entities in DBpedia, an external resource that
                contains structured data about various topics. It helps establish connections between the content of
                the articles and the rich external knowledge provided by DBpedia.</p>
            <pre>
PREFIX dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
PREFIX ns1: &lt;http://www.socialsemanticweb.org/ns/&gt;

SELECT ?article ?dbpediaEntity ?relation
WHERE {
?article dc:subject ?dbpediaEntity .
FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?dbpediaEntity), "http://dbpedia.org/resource/"))
BIND("Linked to DBpedia" AS ?relation)
}
</pre>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This query retrieves articles that are linked to DBpedia resources by
                examining the `dc:subject` predicate. The `FILTER` clause ensures that only URIs starting with
                `http://dbpedia.org/resource/` are included. The `BIND` function adds a relationship label "Linked
                to DBpedia" to these articles.</p>

            <img src="assets/SecondSpql.png" alt="SparQL query" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

            <h4>3. Constructing RDF Data for Articles Linked to DBpedia</h4>
            <p>This query constructs new RDF triples that link articles to DBpedia entities. It can be used to
                populate a knowledge graph or store this relationship for further processing.</p>
            <pre>
PREFIX dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
PREFIX ns1: &lt;http://www.socialsemanticweb.org/ns/&gt;

CONSTRUCT {
?article dc:subject ?dbpediaEntity .
}
WHERE {
?article dc:subject ?dbpediaEntity .
FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?dbpediaEntity), "http://dbpedia.org/resource/"))
}
</pre>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The `CONSTRUCT` query generates new RDF triples that relate articles
                (`?article`) to DBpedia entities (`?dbpediaEntity`). This is a typical query for creating or
                updating RDF graphs where articles are connected to external knowledge sources.</p>

            <h4>4. Articles with Descriptions Longer than 40 Words</h4>
            <p>This query identifies articles where the description is sufficiently long (more than 40 characters).
                It can be useful for filtering articles based on their content length or ensuring that articles with
                detailed descriptions are selected.</p>
            <pre>
PREFIX dc1: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
PREFIX ns1: &lt;http://www.socialsemanticweb.org/ns/&gt;

SELECT ?article ?title ?description
WHERE {
?article rdf:type &lt;http://www.semanticweb.org/raressavin/ontologies/2025/0/NewsProv#NewsArticle&gt; .
?article dc1:title ?title .
?article dc1:description ?description .

FILTER (STRLEN(STR(?description)) - STRLEN(REPLACE(STR(?description), " ", "")) >= 40)
}
</pre>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This query retrieves articles with descriptions that are longer than 40
                characters, using the `dc1:description` predicate. The `FILTER` clause calculates the length of the
                description by removing spaces and comparing the result. The `rdf:type` filter ensures that only
                articles of the type `NewsArticle` are selected.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>This project demonstrates how semantic web technologies can enhance the management and exploration of
                news article provenance. By integrating structured metadata models like DCMI, ITPC Standards, and
                the Social Semantic Web Thesaurus, alongside powerful external knowledge sources such as DBpedia,
                the platform enriches the context and accuracy of news content. Through the use of RDF and SPARQL,
                the system not only enables efficient querying and visualization of articles but also fosters deeper
                interconnections between entities and topics.</p>
